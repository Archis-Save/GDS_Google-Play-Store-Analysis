The Looker Studio dashboard developed for the App Insights Unlocked project provides a comprehensive and interactive view of the Google Play Store ecosystem, enabling stakeholders to explore app performance across categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and update trends. By transforming raw app data into dynamic visual insights, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for app development, marketing, and monetization strategies.

The analysis highlights that user satisfaction and app success are strongly influenced by high ratings, review volume, optimized app size, and regular updates. Categories such as Productivity, Education, and Health consistently demonstrate higher average ratings, indicating strong user trust, while highly competitive categories like Games and Communication lead in installs but require continuous innovation to maintain quality standards.

The dashboard also reveals that free and freemium apps dominate the market in terms of installs, while paid apps tend to maintain slightly higher ratings, reflecting higher user expectations. Interactive filters in Looker Studio allow stakeholders to drill down by category, content rating, app type, and time period, making it easier to identify trends, compare performance, and uncover market opportunities.

Trend analysis of app updates shows increased activity over time, emphasizing the importance of frequent updates to sustain user engagement and relevance. Additionally, the relationship between app size and installs reinforces the need for performance optimization, particularly in storage-sensitive markets.

Overall, this Looker Studio solution enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators in real time, identify high-performing segments, and benchmark successful apps. By leveraging these insights, the company can enhance user experience, optimize development priorities, and drive sustainable growth in the competitive mobile app marketplace.
